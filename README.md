# React Project Series (Easy → Medium → Hard)


I divided this project into three parts—**easy**, **medium**, and **hard**—and built different applications for each level to practice and learn the fundamentals of React, including components, JSX, and styling.  

It serves as a starting point for building and experimenting with modern web applications.

## Features
- React components
- JSX syntax
- Basic styling with CSS


## Project 1: Todo List (Easy)

For the first project, I created a simple Todo List app. You can add your daily plans and tasks, mark them as completed, edit, and delete them.

Built with **Create React App (CRA)**.

---

## Project 2: Movie Explorer (Medium)

For the second project, I developed a movie search engine where you can search for movies, add them to favorites, and list them by fetching data from a database (TMDB API).

Built with **Vite**.

---

## Project 3: Movie Explorer Extended (Hard)

For the third project, I extended the movie search engine from the second project by adding extra features to make it richer.

Built with **Vite**.

---

## Notes


- Project 1 runs with **CRA** → use `npm start`  
- Projects 2 & 3 run with **Vite** → use `npm run dev`  


While building the first project, I used Create React App (CRA). For the second and third projects, I switched to Vite, which is considered a more modern and up-to-date tool. 

Please keep this in mind when running the files.
